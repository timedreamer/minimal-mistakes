I used to write some posts on [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}. It is a very user-friendly platform, a good start point. However, it is not well supported for markdown and the built-in editor is not very convienient, especially for some markdown format. For now, I do not want to host my website on any commercial server that I can use [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/){:target="_blank"}. Thus, I decided to host website on Github Page which is a free platform. I can also use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} for this blog static website.


# Folk a template

To start, I folked the [Github repo][1]{:target="_blank"} from [Minimal Mistakes][2]{:target="_blank"}. It has a beautiful web design and several theme options. Moreover, the documentation is well written. Please check out it's [repository][1]{:target="_blank"}.

# Change user settings

After folk, change the repo name to `USERNAME.github.io` and change some information in the `_config_yml` file.

I noticed a line `github : [metadata]` may be required to avoid Github meta data warning when you build Jekyll locally.

# Install Jekyll locally

You don't have to build the website locally, but it's a good practice. Besides, you don't need to push every time to see your website chagne.

Jekyll is built on Ruby, at least on my Windows 10, Ruby is not installed.

1. Install [Ruby for windows][3]{:target="_blank"}.
2. Install Jekyll from Git Bash, following it's [installation manual][4]{:target="_blank"}.

Now you are good to go.

# Clone the Github repository

After setting up the environment, you can simply clone the repo on your local computer. I found the [Github Desktop][5] is much easier than the command line (for more complicated need you may want to check [GitKraken][6]{:target="_blank"}).

## Add your posts and pages

To add your post/pages, you need to create a directory called `_posts` and `_pages`. Pages is better for content that not change so often, like **About me** page.

## Add images or other documents

To add some images, you can either host on [Imgur][7]{:target="_blank"} or create a directory called `images` under `assets`. `assets` contains all other file contents, include jpg, pdf and many more. Also, I upload a copy of my CV in the directory too.

You can also check out [my Github repo][8]{:target="_blank"} to see how my website is organized.

# Build website locally

To preview your website before push remotely to Github, you will need to run two Jekyll commands. But you do need to upload your image or pdf in order to see the change.

```
# If you just want to see the html file
bundle exec jekyll build

# To run the serve locally
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The use of `bundle exec` will help to avoid version difference that you may encounter.

[This post][9]{:target="_blank"} also helped me a lot to get started, many thanks!
